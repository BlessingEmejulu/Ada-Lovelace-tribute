<p class=" story" > Augusta Ada King. countess of Lovelace was
an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known
for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical
general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She has 
been called as the world's first computer programmer.
What she did was write the world's first
machine algorithm for an early computing machine
that exited only on paper.
